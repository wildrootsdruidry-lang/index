        <div class="content-card">
            <p><b>The Path of the Hedge: My Journey</b>

<p>
I am a walker of the between-spaces.
<p>
Born in the coastal light of Santa Barbara in 1965, I entered this world with a cleft palate and a mind wired differently—a "neurodivergent" soul in an era that had no name for it. My early years were defined by the friction of being AuDHD in a world that didn't yet grok the beauty of a divergent brain.
<p>
By the age of twelve, the call of the road took hold. My early teens were forged in the neon grit of Hollywood, living on the margins. I became a father at fourteen—a child raising a child—and by sixteen, I was caught in the heavy, dark current of heroin addiction.
<p>
<b>From the Asphalt to the Altar</b>
<p>
The turning point came at seventeen, through the hands of a "street mom" with a Harley and a heart of iron. She delivered me to San Francisco, into the care of a Dianic Witch named Sarah. It was Sarah who held the space for me to get clean, introducing me to the Goddess and the tantric secrets of personal power and pleasures of a woman. She taught me the most vital truth I carry to this day: The <i>"once a junkie, always a junkie"</i> narrative is a cage designed to keep you bound. I broke those bars forty years ago and never looked back.
<p>
Through the Rainbow Family and the fire of the EarthFirst! movement, my teenage rage was composted into a deep love for the Earth. I followed the footsteps of Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney, learning that to love the land is to be willing to stand for it.
<p>
<b>Finding the Roots of the Oak</b>
<p>
At twenty-one, in the hushed corners of the Penny Lane coffee shop in Boulder, I met my mentor, Nia "Sparrowhawk" Reese. Under her guidance, I began my formal apprenticeship as a Welsh Druid (<i>I follow the Irish Hearth now</i>).
<p>
My path eventually led me back to Garberville, where the poetry and philosophy of Human Rewilding from Jesse "Wolf" Hardin acted like a catalyst, supercharging my Druidry. It transformed my practice from mere tradition into a living, breathing, primal interaction with the wild. For twenty years in Oregon, I served on and off as a guide for wild food foraging and a coach for primitive living, teaching others how to remember what it means to be human.
<p>
<i>The Hearth and the Heathen</i>
<p>
I am not a fan of the mainstream "Pagan" label; I identify as an Irish/Celtic Heathen. My spirituality is rooted in the hearth, the heather, and the deep ancestral connection to the spirits of the land.
<p>
After years of wandering the country in my Jeep with my faithful dog, Wylla—meeting the kin I found through the digital mists of TikTok—the road finally brought me to a halt. A battle with diabetes in Nashville and a heart attack this past summer were the "omens" I couldn't ignore.
<p>
<i>Today: The Smokey Mountain Hermitage</i>
<p>
I have traded the nomadic life for six acres of homestead in the Eastern Tennessee Smokey Mountains, nestled within a larger Pagan intentional community. Here, under the watchful eyes of my adopted family, I have finally settled.
<p>
As a Hedge Druid of 40+ years, I continue to forage, to listen to the mountains, and to hold space for those who are seeking their own way back to the wild.
<p>
I am a survivor, a father, a student of the old ways, and a witness to the power of transformation.

            <h2>Undomesticating the Mind</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <p>In my early 20s, my time with EarthFirst! introduced me to Jesse "Wolf" Hardin and his concept of <strong>Human Rewilding</strong>. This philosophy shaped the core of my Druidry—it is the constant shadow work of rewilding the mind.</p>
            
            <blockquote>"Writing has become my sanctuary, my medicine."</blockquote>
            
            <p>If you see me on TikTok, you might hear the AuDHD/ADHD speech impediment and the "loud mess". But here, in the writing, you see the true intellect that the mess hides. This site is my refugia.</p>
